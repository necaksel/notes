# class 2 scorer fails on apoc
https://neconcoimmunity.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/ID/boards/20?issueType=10051&selectedIssue=ID-263


Initial plan: 
Tell Elena:
>Hey @Elena Volkova the ID team did a review of our open Bugs today. We want to cancel this issue as the class 2 scorer will be integrated in indit, and indit is only supported for the ... hosts

But after
- [x] Ask Aga is apoc is a supported host for indit

It turns out that apoc is one of the common server. We used to use it a lot, and it is not unreasonable to
expect indit to work on the common servers.

I want to have a look at this issue. But it has a low priority.

Aga:
Focus on the bertmhc image that Hanna is using for class 2 scorer.
If it is just resert (which bert mhc image is abed on ), then we can conclude that this is okay
for us, since we only use bert mhc in the pipeline.
