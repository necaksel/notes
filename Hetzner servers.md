# Hetzner servers

https://robot.hetzner.com/server
Lists all our servers.

Most of the ID servers are AX161.
I can't see that offered from Hetzner anymore
the closest is AX162

20TB of storage box space tied to a server cost just 40Eur a month.
So a 20TB shared disk seems cheap.

Stian and Fredrik larsen are set as contacts for the server.


## Questions
How can I reboot a server?
Under reset I see "Press power button", "Long press power button", and more options.

I want to have my own webside on a hetzner server that is mine.
To learn how to do things.
