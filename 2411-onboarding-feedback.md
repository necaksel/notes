# Feedback for onboarding process

Intro to confluence docs by Aga was useful
Tip to book 1 on 1s was useful.

How to get PIP_EXTRA_INDEX token from servers. Echo on tailscale.

Setup of .ssh/config I needed this for git pull to work from the servers.
```
Host *
  ForwardAgent yes
```

I find confluence and jira confusing and complicated.
Creating a subtask I can't set it to done I have to transition to under development, in testing etc.
I don't understand what issues are actively worked on in the ID dashboard, only some work seems to be tracked?
I create a sub issue but I don't have permission to delete it?

AP models seem like they should be able to do better with much richer protein or peptide knowlege. GO features and protein
metrics seem very limited currently.

AP training data for expressionless models seems simpler. No expression data needed means we should have many more peptides to train on?
Do we actually do this?

Mapping indit pipeline steps to docker image names and then to repo names feels tedious.
I would love to be able to just go to definition in the same code base to find the implementation.

Spreading code into github repos makes it harder to link cursor to the right docs.

Set up a follow up meeting/check in second week? I spent a lot of time reading and testing and optimizing my computer and server setup.
Which I think is useful but I could also have dug into more tasks.

Fast is fun! How can we get faster?
No manual tests on PR. Auto test everything.

Part of why I want a closer to-mono repo approach is that I like using github for managing tasks.
And then the repo is a nice level of organization. When everything is spread out you need
jira to keep the state of what you're working on.
