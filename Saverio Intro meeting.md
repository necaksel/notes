# Saverio Intro meeting
[[Saverio Niccolini]]

I really really like my tasks.
Excited to get to know the team more.

Themes I am thinking about
- Compliance vs iteration speed
- Release cadence (inspired by Trym)
    - Tighter test cycles by keeping code that runs as one in the same repo
    - Working test setup locally
- Inwards looking vs looking for the new
    - tweaking what we have vs looking to find an advance from the last 3 years to completely replace a step. 
    - Kill your darlings
- Opportunity for culture shift
    - People talk about having had a culture of unhelpful secrecy and guarding in the past
    - Pablo is a clear example of the question asking culture I want
    - More discussion in the open, there is not much acttivity on slack that i see
