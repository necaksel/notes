# Cursor demo
What does cursor do:
Indexes your code base.

How to set it up?
Install. Install as shell command.
Enable long context.


What would you show?
1. How to use codebase context   
2. Model selector. 
   1. Claude sonnet for most tasks.
   2. Tricky thinking problem/algorithm and sonnet is failing you? Try o1-preview
3. Apply edits
4. Generate CLI commands
5. Tab complete (same as copilot)

How I work:
1. Starting a task is starting a new thread in cursor
2. Cursor can help you plan and structure work
2. Build useful contex by linking tutorials, and injecting relevant docs.
3. Use the terminal in cursor if you want hassle free copying of console errors or failing tests when debugging.

Neat:
- You can tell cursor what to do. Fex always use polars not pandas.

Extra/unnecessary?
- Index extra docs. And how to see what was indexed?
- Install cursor as cli command. Figure out linux? 
- Composer for fancy edits?
- Debug a test in cursor w chain of thought prompts.
- See what context was used when answering a questoin

Take command to create and go there. Take me there!


Macs seem to be better for AI ingerations.
superwhisper.com and chatgpt app are only on macs. I just like the usability
of the mac native apps. And I like that cursor works out of the box.
