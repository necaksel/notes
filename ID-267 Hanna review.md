# ID-267 Hanna review
[[Hanna Soderstrom]]

We get a set of hotspots out.

```tsv
cluster_index	ID	protein	conserved_sequence	representative_sequence	snebula_score	hla	mean_ap_score	source
1	0_174	E	LVLSPSIYVFNRGRQFY	LVLSPSIYVFNRGRQFY	1	HLA-A*01:01	0.5047	cepi2_1_heatmap_id=0_174-protein=E-taxon=Bovine_coronavirus
1	0_174	E	LVLSPSIYVFNRGRQFY	LVLSPSIYVFNRGRQFY	1	HLA-A*01:02	0.5745	cepi2_1_heatmap_id=0_174-protein=E-taxon=Bovine_coronavirus
```
The hotspot that is present in the most species is the representative
sequence.
The respresentative sequence is always as long as the hotspot cluster.

Made from cluster_n_nb_sequences_458 (maybe?).

md5sum to check hashes.
